1: What Is This?
Ascending Match is the first game created by me (KamiKitsune). It's a number puzzle game where you match numbers from smallest to biggest — hence the name, Ascending Match.

Apparently, it resembles a minigame from Pipe2: Blast Chamber, but that was completely unintentional. I’ve never played that game before. Just a weird coincidence! Anyway, moving on...

Your goal is simple: select numbers in ascending order before the round timer runs out. Each round gets harder with more numbers to match, so stay sharp!

2.1: The Main Menu
This menu isn’t complex or anything — it’s very basic. It only has three options:
- Play: Self-explanatory.
- How to Play: Gives you a brief explanation of the game and controls.
- Exit: Exits the game.

Huh, did I really need to describe this menu? Meh, I’ll leave it in anyway.

2.2: Keyboard Controls
- Left and Right Arrow Keys: Move through the number list
- Space: Mark a number for swapping. Two marked numbers will swap positions.
- H: Tells you how many numbers are in the correct position and which are not
- T: Check remaining time
- Escape: Return to main menu

3: Round Progression
The game gets harder as you go:

- Rounds 1 to 4: Easy — fewer numbers, more time
- Later rounds: More numbers, less time, more challenge
