## 1: What Is This?

**Ascending Match** is the first game created by me (KamiKitsune). It's a number puzzle game where you match numbers from **smallest to biggest** â€” hence the name, _Ascending Match_.

Apparently, it resembles a minigame from _Pipe2: Blast Chamber_, but that was completely unintentional. Iâ€™ve never played that game before. Just a weird coincidence! Anyway, moving on...

Your goal is simple: **select numbers in ascending order before the round timer runs out**. Each round gets harder with more numbers to match, so stay sharp!

## 2: How Do I Play?

### 2.1: The Main Menu

The menu is basic and has three options:

- **Play**: Starts the game.
- **How to Play**: Gives you a short explanation of gameplay.
- **Exit**: Quits the game.

Did I really need to explain this? Meh, it's staying.

### 2.2: Keyboard Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys** â€“ Move through the number list  
- **Space** â€“ Mark a number for swapping. Two marked numbers will swap positions.  
- **H** â€“ Tells you how many numbers are in the correct position and which are not  
- **T** â€“ Check remaining time  
- **Escape** â€“ Return to main menu
